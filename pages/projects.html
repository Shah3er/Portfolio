        <p style="text-align: center;">I have been doing tech since grade 9 to 10 and I have learned a bit of coding like for example as I did arduino coding for 2 years but still need more experience. I also have very little experience of raspberry pi in grade 9 but nothing advanced. I had done not so much but a bit of python. I have loved minecraft and have done a bit of coding with it during grade 8 as it was really interesting. During this course I wish to learn more about coding and see how advanced my skills can be.</p>
